            <p>
                The game is the result of Game Jam 2018 held at Kingston University.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project was done using Unity 2018.2.6f1 and Visual Studio 2017.
            </p>
            <p>
                The team consisted of 5 people: 
                <a href="#">Michael Parollini</a>, 
                <a href="#">Alessio Calore</a>, 
                <a href="#">Dario Tabutabie</a>, 
                <a href="#">Thanaphon Sanogkhun</a> 
                 and me.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the Game Jam, the project was profiled with Unity Profiler. This little investigation 
                showed that the project had performance issues with memory allocation. The issue was caused 
                by player script. In essence, due to costant allocation of particle effects the system 
                was freezing. It happened because of tiredness we received while working on project 24 hours 
                straight.
                cope
